# What-are-the-common-causes-of-infertility-treated-at-Ayuh-Fertility-Centre-

Infertility can happen to anyone, and the reasons are not always the same for every couple. At Ayuh Fertility Centre in Ahmedabad, they treat many different types of infertility problems â€” for both women and men. The good thing is, they donâ€™t just treat the symptoms, they try to find the actual root cause.

Letâ€™s talk about women first. One of the most common reasons for female infertility is PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome). It affects ovulation and makes periods irregular. Many young women come to Ayuh with PCOS and are helped with medicines, lifestyle tips, and sometimes IUI or IVF if needed. Another reason is blocked fallopian tubes, which stops the egg from meeting the sperm. This usually needs IVF to bypass the tubes. They also treat endometriosis, a painful condition where tissue grows outside the uterus and causes fertility issues.

Some women face poor egg quality, especially after age 35. In such cases, Ayuh helps with ovarian stimulation and carefully timed IVF cycles. They even do egg freezing for women who want to preserve their fertility.

On the male side, low sperm count or poor sperm motility are common problems. Sometimes men donâ€™t even know thereâ€™s an issue until a fertility check-up is done. Ayuh does a complete semen analysis and also advanced tests like DNA fragmentation. If the problem is serious, they suggest ICSI, where one good sperm is injected directly into the egg.

Another common problem is unexplained infertility â€” where all tests look fine but still no pregnancy. In these cases, Ayuh may try step-by-step treatments starting from ovulation tracking to IUI and IVF, depending on the case.

They also treat couples with secondary infertility, meaning they had one child before but are not able to conceive again. Itâ€™s more common than people think, and Ayuh offers the right guidance and emotional support for such cases.

What really helps is that Dr. Krupa Shah takes time to explain why the issue is happening and what options are available. Thereâ€™s no pressure to jump into IVF unless it's really needed.
